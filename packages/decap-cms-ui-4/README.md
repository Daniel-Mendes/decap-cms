# Decap CMS UI V4

This package contains the default UI elements that are used in Decap CMS v4.

Part of the 4.0 update is a UI overhaul. This means that the `decap-cms-ui-legacy` package contains the 2.0 and 3.0 styling.
This `decap-cms-ui-4` package is entirely new, and contains the styles, and components for the new UI.
